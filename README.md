MindVibe-AI Mood Journal ‚Äì AI-Powered Emotion Tracker
üß† Project Title
MindVibe-AI is an AI-powered emotion tracking and journaling application designed to help users understand their emotional patterns and improve their mental well-being.

üåç SDG Alignment
This project aligns directly with SDG 3 ‚Äì Good Health and Well-being by providing a tool that fosters self-awareness and supports mental health through technology.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application provides a seamless experience for users to log their thoughts and feelings. Our core workflow is as follows:

User Input: A user writes a journal entry through a sleek, modern front-end interface.

Emotion Detection: The text entry is sent to our Python backend, which then utilizes the Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis API to process the text and generate a sentiment score.

Data Storage: The journal entry and its corresponding sentiment score are securely stored in a MySQL database. For this prototype, we are using Firebase Firestore for rapid development and demonstration.

Visual Feedback: Mood trends are visualized using Chart.js on the user's dashboard, providing instant, actionable insights into their emotional journey.

üõ† Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask framework)

Database: MySQL (for the final version), Firebase Firestore (for the prototype)

AI Integration: Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis API
